# Noroff-Frontend-Assignment-1

In addition to the specs in the assignment, I added a couple of things: 
- I added a check to see if the laptops were "active" before I added them to the dropdown menu.
- I also added a check to see if a laptop is in stock when the user is trying to buy it, and I remove a laptop from the stock when it has been purchased. (This was done without interaction with the backend, though.) Thus, I also added an alert message that informs the user that the laptop is not in stock when that is the case.
